	<summary>In Order to Live -- Maryanne Vollers and Yeonmi Park -- 4/5</summary> 
	Amazing book, had me on the edge of my seat until I finished it. The focus on human trafficking in China and the struggles of adjusting to South Korean culture was unexpected but very welcome.

	<summary>Permanent Recory -- Edward Snowden -- 4/5</summary> 
	Got off to kind of a slow start with Snowden's childhood but quickly picked up in the post 9/11 part of the book. Good mix of some high level technical explanations of how the NSA was able to implement mass surveillance and the personal struggles Snowden went through when deciding whether or not to become a whisteblower. Also, the little bit of Lindsay's diary we got to look at was rather interesting.
